My name is **Michael Graves**. I am a student at Roane State Community College, currently studying for an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Information Tech: Cyber Defense. I ==love== cybersecurity. 
## What is Mike Doing?
I am interested in all things tech, but currently I am working on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), which is an online course that provides a complete path of learning and training to gain the skills necessary to become employed as a web developer. When I am not completing required coursework for my college, that is what I am working on!
